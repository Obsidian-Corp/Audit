## 60-Second Pitch

> "Audit documentation hasn't fundamentally changed in 20 years. Evidence is scattered. Review notes disappear into email. Conclusions can't be traced to their support.
>
> Obsidian Audit rethinks this from first principles. Every conclusion links to its evidence. Review dialogue is preserved. Status is calculated from real work, not manual updates.
>
> When a peer reviewer asks 'what supports this conclusion,' the answer takes three seconds—not three hours."

## Key Differentiators

| Feature | Current Tools | Obsidian |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Traceability | Manual cross-references | Built into architecture |
| Review notes | Lost in email | Preserved on workpapers |
| Engagement status | Manually updated | Calculated from work |
| Time tracking | Separate system | Integrated |
| Finding structure | Free-form text | Condition/Criteria/Cause/Effect |
| Materiality | Excel spreadsheet | Calculator with rationale |

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. TeamMate
TeamMate is document management with audit features added. Obsidian is built around audit reasoning from the ground up.

### vs. CaseWare
CaseWare is powerful but complex—months to implement, consultants to customize. Obsidian is opinionated and works out of the box.

### vs. Workiva
Workiva excels at enterprise compliance (SOX). Obsidian is purpose-built for audit engagements.

### vs. SharePoint/Excel
Custom solutions require maintenance and don't scale. Obsidian is purpose-built and continuously improved.
