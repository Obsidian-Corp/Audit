## 5-Minute Teaser Demo

### Audience
Partner or manager with limited time; qualify interest

### Setup
- Have Acme Corp engagement open
- Be on Workspace dashboard
- Know your 3 key points

### Script Flow

**[0:00-0:30] Context Setting**

> "Audit documentation hasn't fundamentally changed in 20 years. You still have evidence scattered across systems, review notes lost in email, and conclusions that can't be traced to their support.
>
> Obsidian Audit rethinks this from first principles."

**[0:30-2:00] The Core Value - Traceability**

Navigate: `/engagements` → Click "Acme Corporation FY2024" → `/workpapers`

> "Let me show you what's different. This is a workpaper from a tech company audit."

Click into a workpaper with a conclusion.

> "See this conclusion? 'Based on our testing, accounts receivable is fairly stated.' Let me click on the linked evidence..."

Show the evidence → procedure → conclusion chain.

> "Every conclusion traces to its evidence. Not as metadata—as navigable structure. A peer reviewer can verify any statement in seconds."

**[2:00-3:30] The Workflow - Review Notes**

Navigate to a workpaper with review notes.

> "Now watch the review workflow. When a manager adds a review note..."

Show the review notes panel.

> "...it doesn't disappear into email. It's attached to the workpaper. The preparer responds here. When it's cleared, the dialogue is preserved.
>
> Two years from now, if someone asks 'why did we conclude this way,' the reasoning is right here."

**[3:30-4:30] The Integration**

Navigate to Engagement Dashboard.

> "Everything connects. Time tracking is integrated—no separate timesheets. Findings link to their source workpapers. The engagement dashboard shows real status, not what someone remembered to update."

Point to progress percentages.

> "This percentage? It's calculated from actual workpaper status. These hours? From real time entries. When the partner asks 'are we on track,' the answer is the truth."

**[4:30-5:00] Close**

> "This is audit software built by people who understand that audit is an epistemological exercise—building justified belief. The tool should reflect that rigor.
>
> I'd love to show you more. Do you have 30 minutes this week?"

## 15-Minute Executive Overview

### Audience
Partner group, firm leadership; strategic decision

### Setup
- Start on landing page or logged out
- Have all demo credentials ready
- Know the competitive positioning

### Script Flow

**[0:00-2:00] The Problem We Solve**

Start away from the product.

> "Let me start with a question. When was the last time a peer reviewer asked 'what supports this conclusion' and the answer took more than 10 seconds to find?"

Pause for response—this builds engagement.

> "Every firm we talk to has the same challenge. Documentation is fragmented. Evidence is scattered. The chain from conclusion to support exists—but it's in people's heads, not the system.
>
> That's what Obsidian Audit solves."

**[2:00-4:00] Login & Dashboard**

Login as demo@obsidian-audit.com

> "This is the daily view for an auditor. Notice the badge counts—these aren't manually updated. They're calculated from actual work status."

Point out key widgets.

> "My Procedures shows assigned work. Review Queue shows items waiting for my review. Everything I need to know about my day in one place."

**[4:00-7:00] Engagement Deep Dive**

Navigate to `/engagements` → Acme Corporation

> "Let's look at a real engagement. This is a FY2024 audit for a tech company."

Click into Engagement Dashboard.

> "Notice these metrics. 65% complete—that's not what someone typed in a status report. That's calculated from workpaper completion. 40 procedures done out of 62. Real numbers from real work."

Show team section.

> "Here's the team. I can see who's assigned to what, their workload, and progress. No more status meetings to find out who needs help."

**[7:00-10:00] Core Features Walkthrough**

Navigate to Workpapers.

> "This is where the audit work lives. Workpapers organized by reference number—your firm's indexing convention."

Click into a workpaper.

> "Rich text editor, proper formatting. But the key is structure. This conclusion links to this evidence. This procedure generated this workpaper. Everything connects."

Navigate to Findings.

> "Findings are structured. Condition, criteria, cause, effect, recommendation. Not free-form text—structured data we can analyze, trend, and communicate."

Show a finding detail.

> "Management responses are captured here. When the board asks about this finding next year, the full history is preserved."

**[10:00-13:00] Differentiators**

Navigate to Materiality Calculator.

> "Our tools are built for auditors, by people who understand audit. This materiality calculator follows AU-C 320. Select your benchmark, see industry guidance, document your rationale."

Navigate to Review Queue.

> "The review workflow is built in. Items automatically appear in the reviewer's queue. Notes are attached to workpapers, not floating in email. The dialogue is preserved."

Show the signoff chain.

> "Preparer, reviewer, approver. Each signoff is tracked. Peer reviewers can verify in seconds that proper review occurred."

**[13:00-15:00] Close & Next Steps**

Return to dashboard.

> "What questions do you have?"

Handle Q&A, then close:

> "The typical implementation is 4-6 weeks. We'd start with one pilot engagement—low risk, real evaluation.
>
> What would you need to see to feel confident moving forward?"
