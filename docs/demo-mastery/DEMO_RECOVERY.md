# Obsidian Audit: Demo Recovery Playbook

## The Reality
Things will go wrong in demos. Data will be missing. Features will misbehave. You'll get questions about things that don't exist.

This playbook prepares you to handle these moments gracefully.

---

## Core Principle: Never Panic, Always Pivot

The audience doesn't know what you planned to show. They only know what you're showing. Pivot confidently to something that works.

**Rules:**
1. Don't apologize excessively
2. Don't explain technical details of what went wrong
3. Maintain confident body language
4. Have a backup for everything

---

## Scenario: Data Looks Wrong or Missing

### What Happened
You navigate to a screen and the data isn't what you expected. Empty lists, wrong numbers, missing records.

### Recovery Options

**Option A: Acknowledge and Pivot**

> "Let me show you with a different engagement that has more complete data..."

Navigate to backup engagement.

**Option B: Use It**

> "This is actually a good example of a new engagement setup—let me show you how we'd populate this..."

Turn the empty state into a teaching moment.

**Option C: Explain Briefly**

> "The demo environment was reset recently—let me show you screenshots of what this looks like with full data, and then show you the workflow in the live system..."

Have screenshots ready.

### Prevention
- Check demo data 30 minutes before every demo
- Know which engagements have complete data
- Have screenshots of key screens as backup
- Test the exact flow you plan to show

### Recovery Phrases
- "Let me show you this in a different context..."
- "Here's a better example of this..."
- "Let me switch to an engagement with more activity..."

---

## Scenario: Feature Doesn't Work as Expected

### What Happened
You click something and it doesn't do what you said it would. Error message, unexpected behavior, nothing happens.

### Recovery Options

**Option A: Graceful Skip**

> "Let me come back to that in a moment—first let me show you [something else that works]..."

Come back later if it starts working, or skip entirely.

**Option B: Honest Acknowledgment**

> "That's not behaving as expected. Let me show you what it should do..."

Explain verbally and move on.

**Option C: Turn It Into a Strength**

> "This is a staging environment, so occasionally things are updating. In production, this works smoothly. Let me show you the next feature..."

### Prevention
- Test the exact demo flow before every demo
- Know which features are stable vs. in development
- Have a mental list of features you can skip if needed
- Never show features you haven't tested that day

### Recovery Phrases
- "Let me show you that feature in a moment..."
- "While that loads, let me show you..."
- "Let me demonstrate a different way to do this..."

---

## Scenario: Asked About Feature That Doesn't Exist

### What Happened
They ask "Can it do X?" and X doesn't exist.

### Recovery Options

**Option A: Future Roadmap**

> "That's on our roadmap for [quarter]. The way we're thinking about it is [brief description].
>
> What specifically would you need from that feature?"

Turn it into discovery.

**Option B: Alternative Approach**

> "We don't have that specific feature, but let me show you how firms handle that workflow today in Obsidian..."

Show the workaround.

**Option C: Honest No**

> "Not currently. That's an interesting use case—tell me more about how you'd use that?"

Learn from it.

### Key Principle
**Never pretend a feature exists when it doesn't.** Credibility is more valuable than any single feature. Getting caught in a lie kills the deal.

### Recovery Phrases
- "That's a great use case. We're thinking about..."
- "We don't have that today, but here's how firms handle it..."
- "Not yet. Can you tell me more about that need?"

---

## Scenario: They Want to Go Off-Script

### What Happened
They interrupt your flow with "Can you show me X?" or start clicking around themselves if you've given them control.

### Recovery
**This is actually good—it means they're engaged.**

> "Absolutely, let me show you that..."

Navigate to what they want. If you don't know the exact path:

> "Let me find the quickest way to that..."

Take a moment. It's okay to navigate naturally.

### Key Principle
Know the product well enough to navigate anywhere from anywhere. The goal is conversation, not presentation.

### If You Get Lost

> "I want to make sure I show you this the right way. Let me get back to the main navigation..."

Go to a known starting point (dashboard or engagement list) and navigate from there.

---

## Scenario: Technical Problem (System Slow, Can't Login, etc.)

### What Happened
The system is unresponsive, you can't log in, or there are obvious technical issues.

### Recovery Options

**Option A: Backup Environment**

> "Let me switch to our backup environment..."

Have a second environment ready at a different URL.

**Option B: Recorded Demo**

> "While that's loading, let me show you a recorded walkthrough of the key features, then we'll come back to the live system..."

Have a 3-5 minute video ready.

**Option C: Reschedule**

> "I apologize—we're having technical issues. Rather than waste your time with a degraded experience, can we reschedule when I can show you this properly? How's [specific time]?"

Sometimes the right call is to abort.

### Prevention
- Test login 30 minutes before demo
- Have backup environment URL ready
- Have screen recording as nuclear option
- Check internet connectivity (use ethernet if possible)
- Have mobile hotspot as backup

### Recovery Phrases
- "Let me switch to our backup system..."
- "While that loads, let me show you..."
- "I want to give you the best experience—let's reschedule for [time]."

---

## Scenario: They're Skeptical or Hostile

### What Happened
Someone in the room is clearly skeptical, asking challenging questions, or seems determined not to like it.

### Recovery
**Don't get defensive. Get curious.**

> "You seem skeptical—that's completely fair. What would you need to see to be convinced this could work for your firm?"

Listen carefully to the answer. Then address their specific concern directly, or acknowledge if it's a legitimate gap.

### Understanding the Skeptic

They might be:
- **The incumbent champion:** Invested in current system
- **The technical blocker:** Worried about security/IT
- **The budget gatekeeper:** Concerned about cost
- **The change-averse:** Worried about disruption
- **The competitor plant:** Doing competitive intelligence

For each, the approach is different, but it starts with listening.

### Key Principle
Skeptics become your strongest champions if you win them over. They're testing whether you're credible. Pass the test by being honest about limitations while confident about strengths.

### Recovery Phrases
- "That's a fair concern. Let me address it directly..."
- "You're right, we don't do that today. Here's why..."
- "I hear that. What would change your mind?"

---

## Scenario: Running Out of Time

### What Happened
You're mid-demo and realize you won't finish what you planned.

### Recovery
**Prioritize ruthlessly.**

> "I want to be respectful of your time. Let me show you the one thing I think will be most valuable for you, then we can schedule a follow-up for the rest..."

Jump to your strongest wow moment.

### Key Principle
Ending strong matters more than covering everything. Leave them wanting more, not relieved it's over.

### Quick Wrap Options
- Traceability demonstration (30 seconds)
- Review workflow (30 seconds)
- Real-time status (20 seconds)

Pick one, nail it, close.

### Recovery Phrases
- "Let me show you the most important thing..."
- "If you only remember one thing, it's this..."
- "Let me jump to what matters most for you..."

---

## Scenario: Wrong Audience

### What Happened
You prepared for partners, but the room is full of staff. Or vice versa.

### Recovery
**Adjust on the fly.**

For unexpected **staff/seniors:**
> "Let me show you what your daily workflow would look like..."

Focus on: My Procedures, workpaper creation, time tracking.

For unexpected **partners:**
> "Let me focus on the oversight and quality aspects..."

Focus on: Engagement status, signoff chain, QC dashboard.

### Key Principle
Know the product well enough to demo from any persona's perspective with no preparation.

---

## Scenario: You Made a Mistake

### What Happened
You said something wrong, showed something incorrectly, or made a claim that's not accurate.

### Recovery
**Correct it quickly and honestly.**

> "Actually, let me correct myself—what I meant to say was..."

Or if they catch it:

> "You're right, I misspoke. Here's the accurate information..."

### Key Principle
Mistakes happen. How you handle them matters more than not making them. Quick, honest correction builds credibility. Trying to cover up destroys it.

## Emergency Contacts

If something goes catastrophically wrong:

| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Can't login at all | Try backup credentials / backup environment |
| System completely down | Have recorded demo ready |
| Data wiped/corrupted | Use backup environment |
| Major bug during demo | Skip that feature, note to report later |

---

## Post-Demo Recovery

If something went wrong in a demo:

1. **Immediately after:** Send a follow-up email addressing the issue
   > "Thanks for your time today. I wanted to follow up on [issue]—here's the correct information / here's a video showing how that feature works..."

2. **Within 24 hours:** Report any bugs to the team

3. **Before next demo:** Confirm the issue is fixed or adjust your flow to avoid it

---

## Mindset Mantras

Repeat these before difficult demos:

- "They don't know what I planned to show."
- "Confidence comes from preparation, not perfection."
- "Every problem is a chance to show I can handle pressure."
- "The product is good. I just need to let them see it."
- "Skeptics become champions if I win them over."
