## Top 5 Objection Responses

| Objection | Response Key Points |
|-----------|---------------------|
| "Different from TeamMate?" | Architecture. Built for traceability, not just storage. Modern vs legacy. |
| "Implementation time?" | 4-6 weeks. Start with pilot engagement. |
| "Our templates?" | Import and enhance with structure. Convert priority ones first. |
| "Team won't adopt?" | Start with champion on one engagement. It's easier, not harder. |
| "Cost?" | Per-user pricing. But: what's current cost of inefficiency? ROI conversation. |

---

## Emergency Pivots

| If This Happens | Do This |
|-----------------|---------|
| Data missing | "Let me show you in HealthCare Plus..." |
| Feature breaks | "Let me show this related feature while that loads..." |
| Going long | "Let me show you the one most important thing..." |
| They take over | Let them. Answer questions. Know the product. |
| Technical issue | "Let me switch to our backup environment..." |
| Can't login | Try backup credentials. Have recorded demo ready. |
| Wrong audience | Adjust persona focus on the fly. |

## Questions to Ask Them

### Closing
