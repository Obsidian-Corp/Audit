# Obsidian Audit: Wow Moment Catalog

## What's a "Wow Moment"?
The point in a demo where the prospect visibly reacts—leans forward, nods emphatically, or says "that's exactly what we need."

These moments don't come from feature lists. They come from demonstrating that you understand their pain.

---

## Wow Moment 1: Evidence Traceability Click

### The Setup
Open any completed workpaper with a conclusion statement and linked evidence.

### The Demo
> "See this conclusion? 'Based on our testing, accounts receivable is fairly stated.' Let me click on it..."

Click the linked conclusion. Show the evidence chain.

> "In three seconds, I can show a peer reviewer exactly what supports this statement. Every document, every test, every piece of evidence—all connected."

### Why It Resonates
- Peer reviewers constantly ask "what supports this?"
- Currently requires digging through file structures
- Regulators are increasing documentation scrutiny
- This is audit fundamentals, but no tool does it well

### What to Watch For
Partners lean forward. They're thinking about their last peer review, or about PCAOB inspection.

### Best For
Partners, quality control reviewers, anyone who's survived a peer review.

## Wow Moment 2: Preserved Review Dialogue

### The Setup
Open a workpaper with resolved review notes that show the back-and-forth conversation.

### The Demo
> "This workpaper was reviewed last month. The manager had questions—see them here."

Show the review notes panel with responses.

> "But look: the preparer's response, the back-and-forth, and the resolution are all preserved.
>
> Two years from now, if someone asks 'why did we accept this approach,' the reasoning is documented. Not in someone's email inbox. Right here."

### Why It Resonates
- Review notes currently vanish after resolution
- Institutional knowledge walks out the door with staff turnover
- Regulators ask "how did you reach this conclusion?"
- Partners know this is a real gap in current tools

### What to Watch For
Managers nod emphatically. They've lost this context before. They've had to explain decisions they don't fully remember.

### Best For
Managers, seniors who do reviews, anyone who's lost knowledge to turnover.

---

## Wow Moment 3: Real-Time Engagement Status

### The Setup
Open the engagement dashboard showing calculated progress metrics.

### The Demo
> "This is your engagement at a glance. Notice something different?"

Point to the progress percentage.

> "This isn't what someone typed in a status spreadsheet. It's calculated from actual workpaper status.
>
> These 65%? That's 26 workpapers approved out of 40 total. These hours? From actual time entries linked to real tasks. This deadline indicator? It knows what's actually done."

Pause for effect.

> "When the partner asks 'are we on track,' the answer is here—and it's the truth."

### Why It Resonates
- Status meetings are often fiction
- Partners hate surprises
- Current tools require manual status updates that get stale
- Time pressure makes status tracking the first thing to slip

### What to Watch For
Partners who've been surprised by engagement issues. Anyone who's been in a status meeting that didn't reflect reality.

### Best For
Partners, managers, anyone responsible for multiple engagements.

---

## Wow Moment 4: Finding → Source Workpaper

### The Setup
Open a finding detail page that has a linked source workpaper.

### The Demo
> "This is a finding we identified—a segregation of duties issue. But watch: I click 'Source Workpaper' and..."

Navigate directly to the workpaper where the finding originated.

> "The finding isn't floating in space. It's connected to the work that discovered it. The evidence is right here. The procedure that identified it is documented.
>
> When management asks 'how did you determine this,' you're not searching. You're clicking."

### Why It Resonates
- Findings discussions with management can get contentious
- Auditors need to defend their conclusions
- Current tools treat findings as separate from workpapers
- This connection is exactly how auditors think

### What to Watch For
Managers who've had to defend findings to skeptical clients. Anyone who's struggled to find supporting documentation for a finding.

### Best For
Managers, seniors, anyone who presents findings to clients.

---

## Wow Moment 5: Materiality Calculator with Rationale

### The Setup
Open the Materiality Calculator with an existing calculation.

### The Demo
> "Materiality is foundational to every audit. Watch how we handle it."

Show the benchmark selection and calculated values.

> "Select your benchmark—revenue, total assets, whatever's appropriate. The calculation is automatic. But here's what matters..."

Point to the rationale fields.

> "You document WHY you chose this benchmark. Why this percentage. This isn't just a calculator—it's a defensible decision record.
>
> When a peer reviewer asks 'why 5% of revenue,' the answer is documented right here."

### Why It Resonates
- Materiality is always questioned in peer review
- Current approach: Excel spreadsheet, no rationale
- Every firm has had materiality questioned
- This connects judgment to documentation

### What to Watch For
Partners who've had materiality questioned. Quality reviewers nodding.

### Best For
Partners, managers, quality control.

---

## Wow Moment 6: Integrated Time Entry

### The Setup
Show the time tracking widget in the header, then navigate to time tracking.

### The Demo
> "Notice this clock in the header? That's your time tracker."

Click to show the time widget.

> "Start a timer when you begin work. Stop when you're done. It automatically links to the engagement and task you're working on.
>
> No more end-of-week timesheet reconstruction. No more 'what did I work on Tuesday?' The time is captured as you work."

Navigate to the time report.

> "And for managers—real-time budget vs. actual, without waiting for timesheets to be submitted."

### Why It Resonates
- Everyone hates timesheet reconstruction
- Separate time systems mean duplicate entry
- Managers never have current budget data
- Time tracking is universally painful

### What to Watch For
Anyone who's ever struggled with timesheets. Managers who've been surprised by budget overruns.

### Best For
Everyone. This is universally relatable.

---

## Wow Moment 7: Structured Finding Documentation

### The Setup
Open the Create Finding dialog or a finding detail page.

### The Demo
> "When you identify an issue, you document it here. But notice the structure."

Point to each section.

> "Condition—what we found. Criteria—what it should be. Cause—why it happened. Effect—what's the impact. Recommendation—what to do about it.
>
> This isn't free-form notes. This is the professional standard for audit findings, built into the form.
>
> When you need to write the management letter, this structure is already done."

### Why It Resonates
- Condition/Criteria/Cause/Effect is the standard
- Current tools: Word documents with inconsistent structure
- Management letters require this format
- Forces complete documentation upfront

### What to Watch For
Managers who write management letters. Anyone who's dealt with incomplete findings documentation.

### Best For
Managers, seniors who document findings.

---

## Wow Moment 8: Signoff Chain Visibility

### The Setup
Open a workpaper detail or engagement review page showing the signoff chain.

### The Demo
> "Here's the review trail for this workpaper."

Point to each signoff level.

> "Prepared by Sarah on March 15. Reviewed by Michael on March 18—see his notes and the resolution. Approved by the manager on March 20. Partner signoff on March 22.
>
> Every level is tracked. Every signoff has a timestamp and user. A peer reviewer can verify in seconds that proper review occurred."

### Why It Resonates
- Peer reviewers always check review evidence
- Current tracking: signatures on paper, initials in files
- PCAOB wants clear evidence of supervision
- This is professional standards made visible

### What to Watch For
Quality control reviewers. Partners concerned about peer review findings.

### Best For
Partners, quality control, anyone who's prepared for peer review.

---

## Wow Moment 9: Confirmation Lifecycle Tracking

### The Setup
Open the Confirmation Tracker with various confirmation statuses.

### The Demo
> "Confirmations are a nightmare to track. Let me show you how we handle it."

Show the confirmation list.

> "Every confirmation in one place. Bank, AR, legal, whatever you need. Status tracked: sent, reminder sent, received, exceptions.
>
> But here's the key..."

Click into a confirmation with exceptions.

> "When you get an exception or non-response, the alternative procedures are documented right here. The chain of evidence is complete.
>
> Never lose track of a confirmation again."

### Why It Resonates
- Confirmation tracking is universally painful
- Spreadsheet chaos every year
- Non-responses require careful documentation
- Timing is critical and often missed

### What to Watch For
Seniors and staff who actually manage confirmations. Managers who've had confirmation issues.

### Best For
Seniors, staff, anyone who's managed the confirmation process.

## Wow Moment 10: Role-Based Navigation

### The Setup
Login as different users to show different views.

### The Demo
> "Watch what happens when different users login."

Login as staff.

> "For staff, the focus is on assigned work. My Procedures, Tasks, straightforward."

Login as manager.

> "For a manager, you see the review queue, approvals, analytics. Different role, different view.
>
> Same platform, but everyone sees what's relevant to them. No hunting through features you don't need."

### Why It Resonates
- Enterprise software often overwhelms users
- Staff don't need to see admin features
- Partners want oversight, not execution views
- Reduces cognitive load

### What to Watch For
IT administrators, managing partners concerned about adoption.

### Best For
Firm administrators, managing partners.
