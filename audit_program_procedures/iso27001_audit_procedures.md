## Documentation Requirements

### Required ISMS Documentation
1. Information security policy
2. Information security objectives
3. Scope of the ISMS
4. Risk assessment methodology
5. Risk treatment plan
6. Statement of Applicability (SOA)
7. Procedures and controls (as determined by organization)
8. Records:
   - Risk assessment results
   - Risk treatment results
   - Monitoring and measurement results
   - Internal audit program and results
   - Management review results
   - Nonconformities and corrective actions
   - Competence evidence
   - Other operational records

### Documentation Quality
- Documents must be version controlled
- Documents must be approved before use
- Documents must be available where needed
- Documents must be protected (availability, integrity, confidentiality)
- Records must be retained and protected

## Audit Deliverables

### Stage 1 Audit Report
- Readiness assessment
- Document review findings
- Gap analysis
- Recommendations for Stage 2

### Stage 2 Audit Report
- Executive summary
- ISMS scope and objectives
- Audit scope and criteria
- Audit methodology
- Findings (nonconformities and observations)
- Clause-by-clause assessment
- Annex A control assessment (per SOA)
- Conclusions and certification recommendation

### Nonconformity Classifications
- **Major Nonconformity:** Absence or total breakdown of control, significant doubt about ISMS capability
- **Minor Nonconformity:** Isolated lapse or weakness, ISMS still capable
- **Observation/Opportunity for Improvement:** Not a nonconformity but suggestion for enhancement

## Timeline and Process

### Initial Certification Timeline
- **Pre-assessment (optional):** 1-2 weeks
- **Stage 1 Audit:** 1-2 days onsite
- **Gap remediation:** 2-8 weeks
- **Stage 2 Audit:** 3-5 days onsite (size dependent)
- **Corrective actions:** 2-4 weeks
- **Certification decision:** 1-2 weeks
- **Total:** 3-6 months typical

### Surveillance Audits
- **Frequency:** Annual (Years 1 and 2 after certification)
- **Duration:** 1-2 days typically
- **Focus:** Changes, previous findings, sample of ISMS and controls

### Re-certification Audit
- **Frequency:** Every 3 years
- **Duration:** Similar to Stage 2
- **Focus:** Full re-assessment of ISMS

## Audit Time Calculation

ISO 27001 audit time is calculated based on:
1. Number of employees (full-time equivalents)
2. Complexity of organization
3. Number of sites
4. IT environment complexity
5. Maturity of ISMS

**Example audit days (Stage 2):**
- 1-5 employees: 1.5 days
- 6-15 employees: 2 days
- 16-45 employees: 3 days
- 46-85 employees: 4 days
- 86-175 employees: 5 days
- 176-275 employees: 6 days
- (Additional days for larger organizations)

## Required Auditor Competencies

### Certification Body Requirements
- ISO 27001 Lead Auditor certification
- Information security knowledge and experience
- Auditing skills and experience
- Industry knowledge (as applicable)
- Understanding of ISO 19011 auditing guidelines

### Recommended Certifications
- ISO 27001 Lead Auditor (mandatory)
- CISA (Certified Information Systems Auditor)
- CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)
- CISM (Certified Information Security Manager)

## Common Certification Issues

### Most Common Nonconformities
1. Incomplete or outdated risk assessment
2. Risk treatment plan not implemented
3. Statement of Applicability incomplete or incorrect
4. Internal audits not comprehensive
5. Management reviews inadequate
6. Objectives not measurable
7. Competence not verified
8. Security awareness gaps
9. Document control issues
10. Insufficient monitoring and measurement

### Reasons for Certification Failure
- Major nonconformities not closed
- Risk assessment fundamentally flawed
- Management commitment lacking
- ISMS not operational/effective
- Required documentation missing

## Integration with Other Standards

### ISO Family
- **ISO 27002** - Code of practice (detailed control guidance)
- **ISO 27017** - Cloud security
- **ISO 27018** - Cloud privacy
- **ISO 27701** - Privacy management (extension to 27001)
- **ISO 22301** - Business continuity management

### Other Framework Alignment
- **SOC 2:** Significant overlap, can coordinate audits
- **NIST CSF:** Maps well to ISO 27001 controls
- **HIPAA:** Security Rule aligns with many ISO controls
- **PCI DSS:** Payment security complements ISO 27001
- **GDPR:** Privacy controls align with ISO 27701/27001

### Integrated Management Systems
ISO 27001 can be integrated with:
- ISO 9001 (Quality Management)
- ISO 14001 (Environmental Management)
- ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety)
- All use Annex SL common structure (Clauses 4-10)
