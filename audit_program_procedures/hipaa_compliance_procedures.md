## Sample Sizes and Testing Approach

### Risk-Based Sampling
- **High-risk areas:** 20-30 samples
- **Medium-risk areas:** 15-20 samples
- **Low-risk areas:** 10-15 samples

### Specific HIPAA Testing

- **Authorizations:** 15-20 samples
- **Workforce with ePHI access:** 25-30 samples
- **Security incidents:** All or significant sample
- **Breaches:** All breaches
- **Business associates:** All BAs
- **Audit log reviews:** Sample of reviews
- **Training completion:** All workforce

## Required Team Competencies

### Team Composition
1. **HIPAA Compliance Expert** - Overall assessment leadership
2. **Privacy Specialist** - Privacy Rule compliance
3. **Security/IT Auditor** - Security Rule technical controls
4. **Healthcare Subject Matter Expert** - Industry knowledge

### Required Knowledge and Certifications

## Audit Timeline

### Typical HIPAA Audit Timeline
- **Planning and scoping:** 1-2 weeks
- **Document review:** 2-3 weeks
- **On-site testing:** 2-4 weeks
- **Report drafting:** 2-3 weeks
- **Management review and response:** 1-2 weeks
- **Total:** 8-14 weeks

### Testing Frequency
- **Initial assessment:** Comprehensive
- **Annual review:** Risk-based, focus on changes and prior findings
- **Continuous monitoring:** Ongoing for critical controls

## Integration with Other Frameworks

### Related Standards and Frameworks
- **HITRUST CSF** - Comprehensive security framework for healthcare
- **SOC 2** - Service organization controls
- **ISO 27001** - Information security management
- **NIST CSF** - Cybersecurity framework
- **PCI DSS** - Payment card security (if processing payments)

### Coordinated Assessments
HIPAA assessments can often be coordinated with:
- SOC 2 audits (significant overlap in security controls)
- HITRUST assessments (HIPAA is subset of HITRUST)
- Internal IT audits
- Risk assessments

## State and Other Regulations

### Additional Considerations
Organizations must also comply with:
- State privacy laws (may be more stringent than HIPAA)
- State breach notification laws
- Other federal regulations (42 CFR Part 2 for substance abuse, FERPA for student health records)
- International regulations (GDPR if serving EU residents)
